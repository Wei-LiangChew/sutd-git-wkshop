# SUTD Coders Unite!

Welcome to the Github respository for the Git(hub) workshop! This is the first of many fortnightly sessions to come for coders by coders. Do let us know if you have something you'd like to share and conduct a workshop for! We'd be glad to discuss and plan it with you!

You are now reading the Readme file for this repository. This is an important file that should communicate to a new viewer how the contents of the repository should be used, and any requirements needed to use it.

*Note: Files in the repository need not be code-based files! Any type of file can be commited to a Git repository (including image, Word/Powerpoint/Excel, and PDF files), although many of Git's functions are less useful for files that are not purely text-based.*

From this point on, the term 'repo' refers to the repository. You should now set up a Github account if you haven't already done so.

### Languages used in this repo:

* Github Flavored Markdown (used for .md files like this readme)
* Python 2.7.6

### Software Required:

* A Text editor or Python IDE (recommend using Sublime Text Editor or PyCharm. Vim/Emacs for hardcore people)
* Python version 2.7.* installed
* Git (download link: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### The Mission:

In this repo under the /data directory contains CSV files with schedule information on room availability in SUTD. The task is to clone this repo and complete a program that takes a day and time as parameters, and return the rooms that are available. *DO THIS ON A SEPARATE BRANCH OR ALTERNATIVELY FORK THE REPO TO YOUR OWN ACCOUNT*

A file directory structure has been set up with some boilerplate python code to help the distribution of work.

**Bonus Objective**
Modify the above program to also return how long each room would be available for.
